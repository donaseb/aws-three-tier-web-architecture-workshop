#ðŸš€ Hosting a 3-Tier Web Application on AWS
- This project is a practical implementation of a 3-tier architecture deployed on AWS.  I followed the **AWS 3-Tier Web Application Workshop** as a learning guide and added my own understanding and setup steps.
- See [AWS Three Tier Web Architecture](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/85cd2bb2-7f79-4e96-bdee-8078e469752a/en-US)
### Setup :
- download code fron github :
-  ```git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-three-tier-web-architecture-workshop.git  ```
- Create S3 bucket following the steps in the workshop, in this bucket we will upload code and that will be deployed into the servers  .

- Create IAM EC2 Instance Role : go to IAM and create an EC2 role,and select ec2 as trusted entity
- When adding permissions, include the following AWS managed policies:AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore,AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
## Networking and Security:
- In this section we will be building out the VPC networking components as well as security groups that will add a layer of protection around our EC2 instances, Aurora databases, and Elastic Load Balancers.
